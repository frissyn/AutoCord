## AutoCord

AutoCord is a manager for user-created Discordâ„¢ bots on the Replit server. Because the Replit Discord server is primarily a programming and coding server, we allow users to submit bots that they've created and invite them for learning and expirimentation. AutoCord exists to automate and organize the submission process, and to allow you to manage your submitted bots.

**NOTE:** This project is supposed to be open for those with the *Helper* role [@repl-it-discord](https://github.com/repl-it-discord). However, [AllAwesome497](https://github.com/AllAwesome497) is such a lazy bum that I had to make this repo myself. The org can fork it whenever =P (It's unclear if [Zwack](https://github.com/Zwork101) will actually approve this project, so this could all be a waste of time tbh.)

## Contributions

As stated before, anyone with a *Helper* role in the Discord server can conribute. But we won't ignore PRs or issues from those who aren't helpers either. ;)
